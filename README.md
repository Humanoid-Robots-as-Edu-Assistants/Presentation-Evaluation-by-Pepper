# Presentation-Evaluation-by-Pepper
*Attention: this project is only available in German!*<br>

### About

In this project, the Pepper robot serves as both a presentation moderator and an evaluator. Pepper delivers verbal instructions to guide the presenter and the audience in accordance with the predefined scenario. Pepper's capabilities extend to recording the presenter's speech and capturing the audience's reactions, including measures of applause, laughter, and whistle intensity in decibels (dB). Furthermore, Pepper conducts evaluations, assessing both the presenter's emotional expression and the overall quality of the presentation. It's worth noting that this scenario was conceived as part of a Ph.D. thesis exploring the significance of sound recognition within humanoid robots, particularly within educational settings.

### How the program works

At the beginning of the exercise, Pepper provides a comprehensive overview of the procedures to be followed by both the presenters and the audience. Following this, Pepper initiates a timer, accompanied by background music, to allow all presenters to prepare for their presentations effectively. Verbally, Pepper reminds and signals the start and end of each presenter's speech by playing distinct bell sounds. Simultaneously, Pepper extends these verbal cues and bell sounds to the audience, guiding them on when to react to the presenter's speech.

Pepper executes these actions swiftly and seamlessly, ensuring that the audience remains fully engaged without any distractions. Furthermore, Pepper records both the speeches delivered by the presenters and the corresponding reactions from the audience. Utilizing advanced Deep Learning technology, these recorded data are subjected to thorough analysis to evaluate the presenter's skills comprehensively.

Upon completing the analysis, Pepper provides a detailed summary of the results, offering valuable tips and tricks designed to assist the presenter in enhancing specific skills. This holistic approach ensures that both presenters and the audience receive valuable insights, contributing to a more effective and engaging presentation experience.      

### What do you need?

In addition to this program on your Pepper robot, you also need to run the server on the same network as Pepper. The server code can be downloaded from the following link:

### Plans of further development:

We are currently in the initial phase which does not include the presenter speech analysis.
